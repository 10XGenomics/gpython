Put C modules in sub directory
Make an all submodule so can insert all of them easily with 

  import _ "github.com/ncw/gpython/stdlib/all"

Factor main code into submodule so gpython is minimal.

Make a gpython-minimal with no built in stdlib

Bytecode compile the standard library and embed into go files - can then make a gpython with no external files.

** Make a NewErrorf() so can make lots of type errors!

Testing

  python3 -m dis hello.py
  python3 -mcompileall hello.py 
  mv __pycache__/hello.cpython-33.pyc hello.pyc

  go build ./... && go build
  ./gpython hello.pyc
